# Estimating Banking Customer Default Using Classification Methods
In this project, I and my group applied our understanding of classification models to predict credit card defaults for the simulated dataset Default provided in the ISLR2 package, the companion package for the second edition of the Introduction to Statistical Learning. 

This analysis consists of the implementation of 5 classification models:
- Logistic Regression
- Linear discriminant analysis
- Quadratic discriminant analysis
- Classification tree
- K-Neasest Neighbour
